# Mark and Channels

## Mark
A mark is a basical graphical element in an image. We can have marks with differents dimensions. They can rappresent elements and links

## Channels
Visual channels are a way to control the apparance of marks and encode infomration about attributes, indipendently of the dimensionaly of marks. In this picture we can se the main types of channels.
#### Spatial position
#### Color

#### Shape and texture

#### Slope and angle (tilt)

#### Size

#### Example: Bar charts
An example is a Bar chart where the marks are lines the attributes of lines are length and spatial horizontal position, these are two channels.

#### Example: Scatterplot (V1)
Marks in this case are the points in (circles), the attributes of circlles are vertical spatial position and horizontal spatial position.

#### Example: Scatterplot (V2)
This is a differents type of scatterplot where we add a channel, the color for the third attribute (either quantitative or qualitative)

#### Example: Scatterplot (V3)
In this last case we add a different area (2D) to the fourth quantitative attribute (channel 4).

#### Visual decoding
In this charts we see e comparison between 116 years of Olympic spriters with Usain Bolt

### Channel types
Channel can be divided into two different categories, according to the two different sensor modalities oh the human perceptual system: **identity** and **magnitude** channels
- **Identity**: 
- **Magnitude**:

###### Expressiveness
The visual encoding should express all of, and oly, the infomration that is present in the dataset attributes. Do not rappresent information and relationships that are not in the data.

In this example color and position don't rappresent anything and this "violete" this principle.

In other exmaple, the different order in x position don't rappresent anything, change the order change le shape of charts
###### Effectiveness
The importance of the atribute should match the salience of the channel, relevant infomration should be prioritized then encoded with the most effective/accurante channels to be most no...
