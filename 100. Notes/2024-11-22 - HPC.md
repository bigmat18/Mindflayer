# Dynamic Parallelism
Standard program in CUDA are **flat**. Allow Kernel to launch other kernels and manage inter-kernel dependencies. Is useful ti problems that use hierarchical data structures, recursion ecc..

## Balancing the Load
There are applications where the computational load depends on the data.

# Pageable and Pinned Host memory
With **cudaMemcpy** we allocate memory with synchronous call. 
- **Pinned memory** for asynchronous copies
- **Zero-copy** with pinned memory: given the GPU to access directly to the memory of the host with pe PCI
- **Unified virtual addressing** (UVA) 
- **Unified memory** 

## Global device variables
We can allocate global memory dynamically.
