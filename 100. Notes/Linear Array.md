# Linear Array

Assume a linear array with n processors, denoted as $L_n$ we have:
- The **degree** of a network is the number maximum number of neighbors of any processor
$$
\deg(L_n) = 2
$$
- The **diameter** of a network is the length of the longest distance between any two pairs of processors 
$$
dia(L_n) = n-1
$$
- The **bisection-width** of a network is the minimum number of links to be removed to  disconnect the network into two halves of equal size
$$
bw(L_n) = 1
$$
