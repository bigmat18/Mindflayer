# Memory Models and Synchronisation 

## Issues with Notification
Consider the notification using the shared boolean flags. Suppose a machine with **Weak Ordering** 

## Issues with Locking 
In machines with relaxed memory models, spin-locks might not work properly (even if we implemented them with **indivisible sequences of memory accesses**)

## Safety Nets (fences)
Instead of allowing a lot of contrinaints, we tolerate relaxation 
#### Notification
Alternately, **FENCE** instructions can be used to force the ordering.
#### Locking 
The problem in the most cases in unlock phase


# Cache coherence

## Introduction

## Main Copy Semantics

## Automatic vs Manual Solutions

Differents between cahces and scratch pads memoris, the last used manualy programming if with a processors with this memory is a programmer responsability mantain the memory coherence. 

## Update-based Mechanism

## Invalidation-based Mechanism

## Cache-to-Cache (C2C) Transfers
