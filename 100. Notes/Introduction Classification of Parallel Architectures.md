# Introduction Classification of Parallel Architectures

 Parallel Architectures are used to increase performance demand to solve challenging problems in scientific and engine applications.
- **Scalability**: to ensable *scale-out* by adding mode nodes to the system
- **Fault tolerance**: to ensure reliability, if one or mode nodes fail, other nodes can still be used

Parallelism can be apply at all levels of system design. An important aspects that characterize parallel architectures are:
- The system architecture of the single-node
- The interconnection network connecting multiple forming the parallel system

### [[Flynn's Taxonomy]]
Well-recognized and straightforward, but nowadays not so representative yet instructive.
### [[Memory Organization]]
Shared-memory, distributed-memory, hybrid systems
### [[Core count & Processing model]]
CMP, multiprocessors, distributed systems, supercomputers.
### [[Interconnecton Networks]]
Evaluate communication among PEs and memory modules.
