# Inter Time

#### Inter-Arrival Time (Definition)
the **inter-arrival time** $T_{A-Q}$ to process Q is the average time interval between the arrival of two consecutive stream items from P

#### Inter-Departure Time (Definition)
The **inter-departure time** $T_{D-Q}$ time from process Q is the average time interval between the transmission of two consecutive results by Q. It can be calculate by:
$$T_{D-Q} = \max\{T_{A-Q}, T_{id-Q}\}$$
