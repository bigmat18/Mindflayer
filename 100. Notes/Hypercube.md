# Hypercube

The **Hypercube**, detonated by $Q_d (d \geq 1)$, is the graph that has vertices representing the $2^d$ bit strings if length $d$. Two vertices are adjacent if and only if the bit strings that they represent differ in **exactly** a bit position

 HC(d) = Hypercube of degree d
 -  Number of processors: $n = 2^d$
 - $\deg(HC(d)) = d$ and $O(\log(n))$
 - $dia(HC(d)) = d$ and $O(\log(n))$
 - $bw(HC(d)) = n/2$ and $O(n)$
