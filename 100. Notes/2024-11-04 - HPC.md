# Applications of SIMD
SIMD is a computing paradigm related to **data parallelism**. The besics paradigm id map. The SIMD contept has been applied in computing architectures in different ways:
- **Vectorization facilities of modern Processing elements**
- **Array (or vector) processors** 

## Vectorization
Pipelined PE equipped with a more powerful Execution Unit called Vectorization Execution Unit

### Floating-point Instructions
PEs are equipped with FP registrers and an ALU specialized with operations on FPs

## Array processors

### Connection Machine
The connection machine is a member of a series of parallel supercomputers developed at MIT. It's a storical example of array processors.
