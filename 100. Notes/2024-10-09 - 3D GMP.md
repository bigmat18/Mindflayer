## Indexing 

Problem statements:
- Path tracing
- Dynamic/Simulation 

There are some spatial data structure can make it almost const expect logarithmic instead of quadratic

### Non-Hierarchical
Flat space subdivision, it would seem trivial, but there are reasons for them, It's call **uniform grid**.

**Memory occupation** O(#cells + n) not good

#### Spatial Hashing
The same as uniform grid, except that only non empty cells are allocated

### Hierarchical indexing
Divide et impera strategies, the space is partitioned in sub regions.

#### Binary space partition-tree (BSP)
Recursive partitioning the space in two by a hyperplane.

#### KD-Tree
It's a special kind of BSP tree with axis-aligned bisector planes

#### Quad-Tree
The plane is recursively subdivided in 4 subregions by couple of orthogonal planes

#### Oct-tree
It's a quad-tree but in 3D
- **Z-ordering** a system to organize cells visit
