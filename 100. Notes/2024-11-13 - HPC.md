# Physical Memory Hierarchy
In GPU memory hierarchy consists of **programmable memory**.
### Global memory

### Texture memory

### Constant memory

### Local memory

### Shared memory

# GPU Caches
### Fermi model
We have several cores, SP is a core, in each stream multiprocessor have this model, we have 64kb SMEM/L1. 
### Kepler model
In this case we have 32kb + 32kb
### Pascal model

### Volta model

### Ampere model


# Allocations
## Registers
Fastest memory, one **Register file** for each stream multi-processor, lifetime is **kernel scope**
## Local Memory
## Constant Memory

## Texture Memory

## Global Memory


# Shared Memory (SMEM)
The shared memory is essentialy a **stretch-pad memory** directly managed by the programmer. Is a sorted of cached but programmable. 
Shared memory is composed of 4-bytes words and composed of 32 banks. We can allocate SMEM in two possibile ways:
- **Statically**
- **Dynamically**

## API to use SMEM
We can use simply declated in the kernel code a shared-memory buffer

## SMEM Organization
Each SMS module is composed of 32 banks and each bands ca be used to read/write a 32-bit word with request served in 2 clock cycles.

# Parallel Reduction
## Definition
Reduction is a computation applied over an array A of elements of type T. The result is a single element of type T.
## Naive solution
Using atomic RMW instructions.
## Reduction Tree
### First solution

### Second solution

### Third solution
