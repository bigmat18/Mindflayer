# Ampere and Hopper

More recent GPUs like Ampere and Hopper enhance several features introduced with Volta GPUs. For example we have:
- Hopper GPUs feature Tensor Cores capable of applying **mixed precision** (FP8 and FP16)
- Hopper triples the FP operations per second (FLOPS) for TF32, FP64, FP16, and INT8 precisions compared to the previous generation
- **NVLINK** reaching up to **900 GiB/s** of aggregated bandwidth
