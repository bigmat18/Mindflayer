# Parametrization
- Remeshing is one of the contest that use parametrization. 
- Analysis 2D is easier than 3D, when we want use use image processing in a 3D mesh

To do a parametrization we need
- a strategy to flattern 3D surface on 2D domain
- A strategy to introducy cuts

We have two domain:
- surface 
- parameter domain
Mapping is a function $f: \Omega \to S$ and $f^{-1}: S \to \Omega$ in computer graphics we save $f^{-1}$ this because the literature born form 3D representation  in 2D

## Distortion
We want **minimize distortion**, we have two type of minimization of distorntion:
- **angle preservation**
- **area preservation** 
- if we have area and angle preservation we have isometric parametrization. this append when the surface is "sviluppabile"

To calculate distortion we can approximate with first order Taylor expansion

## Bijectivity
Parametrization map must (should) be bijective, the trinalges in parametric domain do not overlap
## Cuts

## Globally Smoothess

## Feature Alignment

## Parametrization tecquinque

### Mass-Spring
The idea is replace edges by springs. 
### Weights
- Wachspress coordinates
- Discrete harmonic coordinates
- Mean value coordinates
