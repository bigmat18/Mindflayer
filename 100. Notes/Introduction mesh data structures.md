# Introduction mesh data structures

The performance, efficiency and memory usage of algorithms on a mesh depends on the mesh data structure that we decide to use. The aspect we need to take into consideration are:
- **[[Representing real-world surfaces|Topological]] requirements**: the kinds of meshes nee to be represented and it's structure and characteristics (pure triangle meshes, 2-manifold mesh, regular, semi-regular ecc..)
- **Algorithm requirements**: The type of algorithm will be operating on the data structure (render a mesh, apply changes over the time ecc..)

Evaluating a data structure requires measuring varius criteria:
- time to construct it during pre-processing
- time to answer a specific query
- time to perform a specific operation
- memory consumption and redundancy
