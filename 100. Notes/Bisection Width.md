# Bisection Width

A **cut** is a set of links that partition the network nodes into two disjoint sets. **Bisection** is a cut that divides the set of nodes into half or nearly half. 
- **Bisection width** is the minimum number of links to be removed to disconnect the network in two halves
- **Bisection bandwidth** is the link bandwidth multiplied by the bisection width of the network

A network has **full bisection** if it allows N/2 messages generated by one-half to reach the other half in parallel.
