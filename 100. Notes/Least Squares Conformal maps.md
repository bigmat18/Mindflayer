# Least Squares Conformal maps

This approach is used to do parametrization using least squares, In this case does't need the entire boundary to be fixed. Imposing that two vectors on UV maps to 2 orthogonal, same length vectors in 3D.

To resolve least square we impose that Laplace of triangles must have $\sigma_1, \sigma_2$ equals.

In this approch need to fix olny 2 vedrtices to disambiguate.
