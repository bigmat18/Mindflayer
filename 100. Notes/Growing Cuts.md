# Growing Cuts

An other approch to do a good sets of cuts is:
1. To a parametrization with one of [[How do Parametrization|methods seen]]
2. Watch the points with higher [[Parametrization Distortion|distortion]]
3. Do the shortest path from this point to boundary
4. Repeat with a new boundary

With this technique can be happen that throw this process if we don't limit with circle boundary the parametrization can became not bijective.
