# Alpha Shapes

An alpha shapes is a generalization of concept of **Convex Hull**. A Convex hull is the union of all half-spaces that lean on my point cloud. In other words it's the minimal convex solid that I can do around an object.
$$CH(S) = R^d \setminus \bigcup EH(S) $$
Where $EH(S)$ is the halfspace not containing any point is S.

The result has the problem that it is convex, for this reasons it can not approximate not convex shape. For own case we use **Alpha Hull**, where we replace the halfspace with spheres.
$$\alpha H(S) = \mathbb{R}^d \setminus \bigcup EB_{\alpha}(S)$$
Where $EB_{\alpha}(S)$ is the ball with radius $\alpha$ not containing any point S. When the radius tends to infinity we have a sets of plane, when we start to decrease the radius pt's as if the halfplane were curved.

### Computing Alpha Shapes
To compute alpha shapes we use:
- **Alpha diagram**: [[Voronoi Decoposition |Voronoi Diagram]] restricted to space closest than $\alpha$ one point in S.
- **Alpha [[Representing real-world surfaces|Complex]]**: Subset of [[Voronoi Decoposition|Delaunay Triangulation]] (if two cells of voronoi are adjacent insert and edge) computed as the dual of the alpha diagram.

L'**alpha complex** is the triangulation built on the alpha diagram.

The **input** is a point cloud:
- In classic voronoi we compute a **[[Voronoi Decoposition]]** and after we do the delaunay triangulation in which we add a edge for voronoi cells adjacent.
- In **alpha shapes** we do alpha diagram, we take the voronoi diagram limited by sphere (we exclude cells to infinity), the following alpha triangulation is a subset of delaunay triangulation and **it's not convex**

Build the **alpha shapes** (for all radius) from the delaunay triangulation is a simple operation, we remove all edge where the circus passing through 3 vertices is bigger than a certain radius

- $\alpha = 0$      $\alpha$-shape is the point set
- $\alpha \to 0$     $\alpha$-shape tends to the convex hull
- A finite number of thresholds $\alpha_0 , \alpha_2 , \dots \alpha_n$ defines all possible shapes (at most $2nÂ² - 5n$)

### Sampling Conditions for Alpha Shapes
Obviously is not sure the results is [[Representing real-world surfaces |manifold]]. This depend to point layout, if we know that the points have a good arrangement probably the final result will be a manifold mesh. The condition to have a good mesh are the following:

Given a smooth manifold M and a sampling S. If it holds that:
1. The intersection of any balls of radius $\alpha$ with M is homeomorphic to a disk 
2. Any balls of radius $\alpha$ centered in the manifold contains at least one point of S.
Then the $\alpha$-shapes of S is homeomorphic to M.
