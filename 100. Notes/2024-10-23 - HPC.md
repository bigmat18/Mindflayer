# Memory Consistency
## Consistency Models Matter
We have two kinds of information:
- **Private variables**:   
- **Shared variables**: 
The answer to shared variables access is related to the **memory consistency model**, memory consistency issues are often a matter of **system developers** of run-time supports for parallel programming.
#### Example 1
- Suppose we have two memory locations A, B 
- They are both initialise to 0
- Each processor has its own local cache and cache lines are kept **coherent** with each other
#### Example 2

#### Example 3

## Sequential Consistency 
Each instruction by any PE is started and completed in the program order and all the PEs always see the same global order of memory instructions.

### Cost of SC
The implementation of SC in modern machines prevents most of the optimisations that are possibile nowadays.
- **Write buffers**
- **Out-of-order execution**
- **STORE atomicity**

## Relaxed memory models
Each relaxed memory model allows some specific reordering of memory accesses issued by the same PE.
- **W <- R**
- **W <- W**
- **R <- R**
- **R <- W**
