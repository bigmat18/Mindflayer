### Other Network Topologie
Low-diameter topologie such as **Dragonfly** (diameter = 4), **Slimfly** (diameter = 3), **Megafly** and **HyperX**. One of this for example, the **Dragonfly topology** is:
- A set of ùëé ‚â• 2 switches forms a **group** (called **router**)
- The switches within a group are fully connected
- Each group (router) is connected with p processing nodes
- Each group (router) has h links

**Example**: dragonfly formed by 8-port routers. Each router has 4 switches for a total of 9 groups (72 nodes).
