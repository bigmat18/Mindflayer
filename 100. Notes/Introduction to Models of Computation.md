# Introduction to Models of Computation

Sometimes, instead of implementing a complex algorithm directly on a specific parallel system, it is better to explore its possible limitations independently of a specific architecture  and programming language. Theoretical parallel models of computation may be helpful for such exploration.

They allow the programmer to focus first on the best algorithm and then on how to deal with specific technological limitations. Additionally, they may provide **lower bounds** for the implementation on a real machine. A lower bound sets a limit on **the best performance any algorithm can achieve for a problem**.
