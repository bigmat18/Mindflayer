# Pipeline Processors

Pipelined processor executes in parallel more instructions. Each stage works on a different instruction of the program (use a [[Pipeline]] pattern).

That can increase a lot the efficiency of processor compute more operations in less time, like in the image above.
### Data Hazards
Pipeline introduces parallelism at the expense of data **dependencies** (**[[Bernstein Conditions|read-after-write]]**) that might generate issues. For example:

Otherwise **RAW dependencies** between LOAD-ADD and ADD-STORE can create issues in a pipeline processor if that situations they are not treated in a correct way. The pipeline **stalls** to respect them:

Jumps (**unconditional** and **conditional** with the jump taken) might generate issues in the pipeline since we are changing the generation source of the input stream (instructions). In the figure below we have a **RAW dependency** between LOAD-IF and a **control dependency** generated by the IF (taken)
