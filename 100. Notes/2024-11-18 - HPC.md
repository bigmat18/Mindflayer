# Stencils

## Origin
Stencil-based computations often derive from numerical methods to solve partial differential equations. 
## Stencil Sweep
### 2D
In stencil computations originating from **finite-difference methods**, the boundaries will not changes form input to output (white elements)
### 3D
This is the case where stencil is often used. 
## Naive Kernel 
Compute one point in 3D space. This solution has a lower floating point ration (0.47)
## Tiling Approach
The arithmetic intensity can be improved with **tiling**. In 3D case the arithmetic intensity is less than 3.25.
### Issues
- We have hard limit to the block size makes things more complicated.
- To compute one output elements we must read many elements, but not alla elements is read by multiple threads. **Halo elements** are less used.
## Thread Coarsening 
- **Challenge 1 (block size limit)**
- **Challenge 2 (SMEM capacity limit)** 
#### Challenge 1
Each output tile is going to be computed by a block having a number of threads equal to a x-y plane of the input tile only.
#### Challenge 2
Each block compute one x-y plane of the input tile.
