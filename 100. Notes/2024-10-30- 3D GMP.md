# From Point Clouds to tassellated surfaces 

The biggest problems is about the noise:
- **sampling incaccuracy**
- **scan misregistration**: when we put toghether different allinitation we can do some error that have strogest bias

The point samples may not be uniformly distributes:
- **oblique scanning angles**
- **laser energy attenuation** 

Ofter there are missing data:
- material, properties, inaccessibility, occlusion

###### Explicit methods
Build a tessellation over the point cloud.
- less robust to noise
- require a dense and event sampling
- generally easier to implement
###### Inplicit methods
Assuming that points are a sample and we must found an approcimation
- more robust to noise
- more resilient to noise and uneven sampling

## Explicit methods

### Alpha Shapes

### Ball Pivoting

### Mesh Zippering
