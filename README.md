## 🗂️ Structure

The vault is organized to facilitate knowledge discovery and management, with a focus on interconnectedness and atomic notes:

-   **`000.Areas/`**: High-level areas of life and knowledge that are ongoing and evolving.
-   **`001.Projects/`**: Specific, time-bound initiatives and their associated notes, tasks, and resources.
-   **`010.MOCs/` (Maps of Content)**: Index notes that curate and connect related notes, offering structured overviews of topics.
-   **`011.Tags/`**: Notes primarily organized by tags, acting as dynamic index points for specific keywords or themes.
-   **`100.Notes/`**: Atomic and reference notes covering a wide range of subjects, the core building blocks of the knowledge base.
-   **`101.Utils/`**: Helper scripts, configurations, or utility notes.

> **Note:**
> The vault is a living document; this structure may evolve. Notes are often linked across different top-level folders to reflect their interconnectedness, rather than being strictly siloed.
