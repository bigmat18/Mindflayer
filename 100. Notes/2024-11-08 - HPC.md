# GPU Abstract Architecture
Each kernel ia a grid of blocks where each block contains several threads. Each block of thread of the grid is executed by a SM.

A block of 32 threads is called a warp. Warp is a unit of scheduling.
## Control Divergence 

## Latency Hiding 

## Logical-Physical Mapping

# SIMT Model 

## Pre-Volta
**Single instruction multiple Threads** (SIMT). Volta model change the way how the threads are scheduled. 

In pre-volta each warps has a **single program counter** and **stack** shared by all 32 threads.
### Stack-based Reconvergence 

## Post-Volta
Now each threads have the own program counter-
