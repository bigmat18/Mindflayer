# MIMD (Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data)

MIMD architectures are the basis of high-performance machines and supercomputing nowadays. They are inherently **general purpose** and range from **low/medium-level parallelism** (10-100) like shared-memory servers, to **high-level parallelism** (1000s) like clustersom.

- A set of PEs simultaneously execute different instruction sequences on different data streams.
- MIMD architectures are the most commonly used in parallel architecture
- Each processor can execute all instructions.
- Can be further classified based on memory organisation and interconnection topologies used
- Examples
	- Standard off-the-shelf CMPs
	- Clusters and most supercomputers
