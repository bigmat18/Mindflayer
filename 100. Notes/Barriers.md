# Barriers

The main **goal** is the following: a barrier is a synchronization primitive for a group of $N>1$ processes/threads (called **entities** from now on). Any entity reaching the barrier must wait until all entities have reached the same barrier. Then all entities in the group can go on.

**Evaluation aspects**:
- Length of the critical path
- total communication perfomed
- storage requirements
- implementation requirements, and so forth
