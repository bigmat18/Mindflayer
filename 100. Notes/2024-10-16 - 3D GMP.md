# Sampling

Process to sample a domain, these techniques are used for example, point based rendering, photorealistic rendering, gaussian splatting.
- Strongly connect to remeshing techniques 
- Many usage in rendering 

## Jittering
- **Random** with a random sample of domain, we are taking random (x,y) points for  cause a domain not uniformly sampled
- **Uniform**: domain uniformly but not in random way
- **Jittered**: Uniform & random. Trading aliasing for noise

## Poisson Disk Sampling
Poisson Disk Sampling 
1. Minimal distance: if a put a disk around each sample, the disks don't touch each other.
2. Unbiased sampling
3. Maximal sampling property

### PDS on surfaces
There are two metrics when we work on a surfaces domain:
- **Euclidean distance**
- **Geodesic distance**

The HDT is sample to adapt in a surfaces domain
- Replace uniform grid with triangulation
- Replace quadtree with 1-4 triangle subdivision

Example uses:
- **Sub-sampling point clouds** 
- **Edge preserving sampling**

# Voronoi Decomposition

Split a domain in base to information obtain in the intorno.
