# Gaussian Curvature

Defined as $K = k_1 \cdot k_2$
- $> 0$ when the surface is a sphere. This is a point goes outwards or inwards. Curvatures with same sign.
- $0$ if locally flat (also called **developable**)
- $< 0$ for hyperboloids. This happen when in this point the curvatures have opposite sign.

A point x on the surface is called:
- **Elliptic**: if $k > 0$ ($k_1$ and $k_2$ have the same sign)

- **Hyperbolic**: if $k < 0$ ($k_1$ and $k_2$ have opposite sign)

- **Parabolic**: if $k = 0$ (exactly one of $k_1$ and $k_2$ is zero)

- **Planar**: if $k = 0$ (equivalently $k_1 = k_2 = 0$)

### Developed surfaces
An interesting property is a surface is a **developed surface** iff $K = 0$. Flatting introduce no distortion.

### Intrinsic / extrinsic
Gaussian curvature is an **intrinsic** properties of the surface (even if we defined in an extrinsic way). It is possible to determinate it by moving on the surface  keeping the geodesic distance constant to radius r and measuring the circumference $C(r)$
$$K = \lim_{r\to 0} \frac{6\pi r - 3C(r)}{\pi rÂ³}$$
This is another way to measure the curvature and it is the limit of variance of circle at the radius increases.

### Gaussian curvature on triangle mesh
It's the angle defect over the area:
$$K_G(v_i) = \frac{1}{3A} (2\pi - \sum_{t_j \:adj \: v_i}\theta_j)$$
**Gaussian-Bonnet Theorem**: The integral of the Gaussian Curvature on a closed surface depends on the [[Representing real-world surfaces|Euler Number]].
$$\int_S k_G = 2\pi \chi$$
This can be more intuitively than it looks: the local deformation don't change the integral of Gaussian curvature. If we image a plane surface, if we stretch the surface to high we add positive curvature to top and negative in the ring at the base.

The only thing that change is when we add a hole.
