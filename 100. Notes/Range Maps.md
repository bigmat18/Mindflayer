# Range Maps

Not only point cloud: the **Range Maps** or structured point cloud. [[Introduction to Surface Reconstruction|3D scanners]] produce a number of dense structured height fields, that is, a regular $(X,Y)$ grid of points with a distance Z value. There are called **range maps**. They are trivial to triangulate use the regularity of sampling.

One of the main question is how to merge different range maps? It's very difficult for the different noise and local deformations of surface.
