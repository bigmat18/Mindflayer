# Marching cubes

Marching cubes is an algorithm to convert implicit surface representation to parametric surface. This is a grid based method in which samples the implicit function on a regular grid and process each cell the [[Signed distances field|discrate distance field]] separately.

###### Input 
- A regular 3D grid where each node is asociated with a scalar value $f$ (i.e. a scalar field)
- A scalar value $\alpha$

###### Output
- A surface with scalar value $\alpha$ and non null gradiant (the isosurface)

The general algorithms is:
- For each cell that is intersected by a isosurface S a surface patch is generated
- The collections of all these small pieces eventually yields a triangle mesh approximation of the complete isosurface S.

For each grid edge intersecting the surface S the algorithms compute a sample point approximates this intersection. The sign F differs at the grid edge's endpoints $p_1$ and $p_2$. This approximations is linear along the grid edges. $d_{1} := F(p_1)$ and $d_2 := F(p_2)$ 
$$s = \frac{|d_{2}|}{|d_{1}| + |d_{2}|}p_{1} + \frac{|d_{1}|}{|d_{1}| + |d_{2}|}p_{2}$$
The result sample points of each cell to a loop-up table holding all possibile configurations od edge intersections.

Marching cubes computes intersection points on the edge of a regular grid only, which causes **sharp edges** or **corners**. 
###### Pros
- Quite easy to implement
- Fast and not memory consuming
- Very robust
###### Cons
- **Consistency**: Guarantees a C0 and [[Representing real-world surfaces|manifold]] result: ambiguous cases
- **Correctness**: Return a good approximation of the real surface
- **Mesh complexity**: The number of triangles does not depend on the shape of the isosurface. If we have a plane, we do a lot of triangles in relations to sampling value.
- **Mesh quality**: arbitrarily ugly triangles. If I want an isosurface very close to a 2 vertex aligned on same axes we do a very long and tiny triangle.

#### Ambiguous cases
In the following situations:

We donÂ´t know a a surface was connected, it's not enough see the lookup table to fix these types of problems. We need to play with the approximation of the function that we want represents. 

The value of the scalar function inside each cell is interpolated by the (known) value of its 8 corners.
$$T(x,y,z) = axyz + bxy + cyz + dxz + ex + fy + gz + h$$
Where:
- $a = v1 + v3 + v4 + v6 - v0 - v7 - v5 - v2$
- $b = v0 + v2 - v1 - v3$
- $c = v0 + v7 - v4 - v3$
- $d = v0 + v5 - v1 - v4$
- $e = v1 - v0$
- $f = v3 - v0$
- $g = v4$

We evaluate how much worth the field in the interpolated function in the center of cube, and if in this point the value is above the threshold (red) that means we are in first situations (the one at the top) else we are in the second situations

### Extended marching cubes
To resolve this problem there is **Extended marching cubes** algorithm that check the distance function's gradient $\nabla F$ to detect those cells that contain a sharp, and than it find an additional sample point by intersecting the estimated tangent planes at the edge intersection points of the voxel.

By using point and normal information on both sides of the sharp feature, one can find a good estimate for the feature points at the intersection of the tangent elements. 

In the following image, the dashed lines are the result the standard marching cubes algorithm produce, and the bold lines are the tangents used in the extended algorithm.

### Dual countering approach
This approach extract meshes from adaptive octrees directly. In contrast to marching cubes this approach generates vertices in the interior of the voxels and constructs a polygon for every voxel edge that intersects the isosurface.

A **problem** in this approach yields [[Representing real-world surfaces|non manifolds]] for cell configurations containing multiple surface sheets, an other approach to mitigate this problem is the **cubical marching squares algorithm**.
